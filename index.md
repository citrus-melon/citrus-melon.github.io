![In progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-In%20Progress-blueviolet)

A web app for use in childern's swim meet competions. At these competitions, swimmers are called to the bullepen for their events. This app has two parts, a "controller" and a "receiver." The receiver is meant for use on a large screen, which displays the current event number to swimmers. The controller is meant for controling the receiver from a mobile phone.
